# META MARKETING ANALYTICS PROJECT
 
Inu + Neko is a company you’ve seen a lot in this course. As a reminder, they are a pet supply and services company that just started an e-commerce business. You have been asked to help them analyze their data to help them make better decisions in the future. 

Inu + Neko had a lot of success with a marketing campaign and is seeing a lot of growth. The company wants to know how these new incoming customers differ from their past customers. Are there different items they should stock more of? Are there other things they should conside

The csv file  are the sales numbers for Inu + Neko over a 6 month period. The data are in pretty good shape, but are not perfect. 

In the Jupyter notebook below, you’ll be asked to perform a series of actions to clean the data. For example, you can see that these data still needs to be scrubbed. (Note these are different data than what you’ll be given.)


In the data scrubbing, we’d like to:

Determine how many duplicate records there are.

Remove any duplicate records you find (the full rows). 

Fix the inconsistencies in the column cust_state.

Correct the values in total_sales column (prod_price * trans_quantity).

Validate the prices in prod_price. Remove any rows that are obviously wrong.

How many missing values are there?

Drop the column with missing values.



 In the data exploration, the findings below will be inputed:

How many transactions are there?

Which days were the first and last transactions?

Which animal product type is more popular?

What was the total dollar amount made in the month of January? 

What was the total dollar amount made in the month of June?

What is the average number of items bought in each transaction?

What are the top ten products by the number of sales? Display in descending order.

What are the top ten products by revenue? Display in descending order.

Bonus Question: How many customers are returning?
